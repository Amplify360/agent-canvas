- name: Business Acquisition Proposal Agent
  phase: ideation
  category: Finance & Controlling
  objective: Ensuring high quality & standardised acquisition proposals that can be
    submitted to higher executive functions (International President / CRH CEO / CRH
    Board) for approval.
  description: "Agent would be used to draft proposals for business acquisitions which\
    \ are then submitted to International President / CRH CEO / CRH Board for approval.\
    \ Currently local teams (often non-native English speakers) draft proposals and\
    \ require a lot of redrafting / editing before they are in suitable condition\
    \ to share with Senior Management. \n\nWe have a large backlog of approved Proposals\
    \ and clear formatting / style guidelines to support the agent. For each proposal\
    \ there is also a acquisition model (again a template version) ... it would be\
    \ helpful if the proposal could be updated quickly to capture model outputs as\
    \ these often change late in the process.\n\nVALUE MEASUREMENT: At an International\
    \ level we probably draft 40+ proposals a year (including business acquisitions\
    \ / divestments / real estate transactions) ... proposals are typically 10-15\
    \ pages long. Often local teams (opco level) might draft one or two a year and\
    \ with staff churn we end up having to reteach how to draft proposals in the appropriate\
    \ style which is very time consuming. KPI would be number of hours spent by Development\
    \ (International and local level), Strategic Finance (International level), Investment\
    \ Assurance (Group) level."
